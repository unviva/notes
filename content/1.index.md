# MISCALCULATOR

## Relativeness
Also finds it‚Äôs roots in etymology, human relations are bound to relativeness. Which mainly refers to comparability of two or more persons.

Can etymology be the right reference here to rely on? Certainly not.

Since human life is a personal term, rather than social; relativeness, with comparability to others and with other effects, is the biggest threat to one‚Äôs joy from life.

---
* If you ask them, everyone himself is most valuable and most undervalued. Graded by unknown.

* and the bird has said, "who is flying better?"

* unluckily, he/she had an appearance looked challenging to others.

* what a luck, is others hate.

* Search for meaning, is possible root of relativeness.


## Solitude (Isolation) of Mind
- response, empathy, sympathy, values, expectations

And I jumped over the table. As I wanted to.

## Reason or Meaning
Life gets progressed of reasons, causation, and I ask you the meaning.

what is the meaning, you are reading this text?

## Aesthetics
Against aesthetics = unwanted (disturbing) result

such as bad humor.

## Purpose/Relation/Affect
Certainly Starlink hasn't been invested to interfere your night-sky view, but it does.

## Parasite
Since human can produce, it eventually becomes parasite to each other.

Love, marriage, inflation, currency, immigration, boss, employee (not worker), taxes... is to name some forms.

## Becoming
Everything is in state of becoming. It keeps becoming.

## Equation
That said, the problem and the solve is always on same body.


## Objective
Life is ‚Äúobjective‚Äù, since there is no such thing ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù.

- ‚ÄúFans‚Äù were not celebrating the goal.

Although the goal itself subjective, the fan himself, denies the goal or doesn‚Äôt celebrate the goal, for some reason. Which takes precedence on own perspective. 

In another dimension, there is no such thing called ‚Äúgoal‚Äù. where you don't have a name.

## Rush
He was in big rush and his friend has asked 
- "where are you going?"
- I don't know (but makes me look important, not be neglected)

> life, human, existence, psychology, relativeness (incl. business and governments)

why marriage?
why aggression?
why sitting on chair all day?
why calling me several times every day?

"I don't know" is at the center of global human activity. 
hopefully would resolve to: person with conscious/awareness. senseful.

Mr. senseful bigunderlined üòÄ

## Story
Is this really yours?

## Goal-oriented
- What a pity üòÇüòÇüòÇ (a tribute to Dionysos)
- Good boy (reply by Dionysos)

## Defected
Taking advantage of being defected. such as sick and degenerated me üòÇ

(memorial of Apollon, Side, Antalya - 27/12/24)

## House
Let's say, you wake up in a house, full of food and wines, movie theater and a sound system...etc. what would be your next action?

A- enjoy everything you have until you lose it
B- to find out "how I ended up here"?

## Evilization
because I am the good one. üòá
is a process similar to "stupidization"

## Mind Clear
What is dirty mind? And a dirt in mind?
- call for offence
- patriotic view (just because...)
- superiority and minification (such as leader cults)
- blame
- parasitic approach
- hate
- gender oriented view (just because man/woman. i.e. boys don't cry) ...

Is it only your mind? No. Others also have it in a society.

How does it spread? Using all society tools.

Although it is fun when it harm others (!sarcasm), a dirty mind mainly harms the owner.

Having a clear mind, requires
- awareness
- find out non-sense part
- continous challenge and not to lose, until fully clear
- isolation (maybe)

should be taken on individual level. not on others.

## Method
Difference of methods is to be reflected on the person. Produce, get spoiled, go gangster or win the lottery. Charm or seduce.

## Company
Every day is like being a guest in someone else's company. Somedays I'm about to ask "may I take a shower?". Every company could have been a project and run by project managers, with same duty as other staff. Public financials, revenue sharing ... and so on.


## Orbit
Mass-gravity rule (understanding) may be over.

Rotational speed of earth may be definer of distance to sun. Both stable.

Adding radius and mass, entire galaxy can be an equation, resulting zero, since balanced.

It keeps rotating. and. Can not get closer because it is fast. Can not move away because its slow.

Ellipsis imbalance, may be due to some other reason
In this respect, fall is an outcome of air-pressure only and no reason to keep up.



## Motion of Hunger
Hungry for
- knowledge
- power
- food/water
- attention
- love
- quality
- intelligence
- admiration
- pleasure
- discovery
- fun
... so on.

## Limited
is limited. such as mentally.
(special thx Doƒüan C√ºceloƒülu)

## Boredom
The loop, especially when it's periodic.


## Reflections
(possibly) your question in mind takes you places with reflections, which may reflect you the case. 

you may interpret it as the answer based on your perception.

requirements
- observation
- patience for lag (not instant)

(possibly) to remove this effect is to refuse any way of connection other than direct.

basically, it works, just because you want it to work that way.

## Interaction
is the word you are looking for.

which has inner connections (not limited to visible), under singularity.

is a topic connected with cause, context and reflections. such as birth of Athena. all of a sudden.


## Process
you rarely get the result instantly.

## Cost
Cost of (something).

such as riding bike, leg muscles, healhty lungs, balance and dangers ahead and the one sitting at back.

and the ones building own bike. and ones doing it better.

and the journey through Japan.

and the winged rhinoceros üòÇ

and storm, and disease, and dirt, and cold, and hot, and thunder ‚ö° 

and the one misunderstood. 
and the one got bored.
and your story.

end.




# CANDIDATES SECTION

## The Set
in harmony, covering all aspects of life. my set.

what you see around, is an export of mind of society members.

fk society football club. üòõ

## Love
one loves another, betrays self. makes all "loves" end in pain.

## Hungry for Chaos
looking for any reason. bored again.

## Ethics
The demand for ethics is unethical, so paradoxal.

Is putting the other person into "have to" state, forcing to obey.


## Ball
All life takes place on a ball that turns non-stop.

At this place, everyone's focused on their journey and can't help others even on most prosperous day.

The will, gets place above everything else to survive, to impact, to realize the life.

Probably many observed, a dog or a bear can not go further when cat is reacting. So life checks if you are still alive or just breathing and chit-chatting around.

Probably they know, one looks alive, may be their end as well.

Life requires some minimum amount of will, rather than being traded for non-life things.


## Return
Biggest issue for human life. same carpet, same events, same return after some time.

It‚Äôs possible to break out locally by breaking daily routines or sudden changes to daily plans. however it gets stuck to return again due to outer circle after reaching maximum.

I wish life flows in a way (for everyone) that i can change my life in a day, leaving all house and belongins behind, that i run away from them.

difficult process of making an application, meetings, tests, paperwork is blocking people, not to mention burden called CV. My objective? make money. what else can be? I think saxophone is nice as a saxophone, not on objectives section of a CV.

No ones happy to lose time in wrong place for them.

My best day in life, the day i moved to USA. Not because it's USA, but everything new, a different lifestyle to see, everything changed, i felt first time i breathe at my 30, when i settle in my room in Greek village.


## Tricky
A threat or confusing sentences or humiliation or hail or surprises ....

now I am, who knows what is for why, instead of living what it's trying to give to me.
